# Cloudflare Worker Adapter Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented a Cloudflare Worker-compatible build for @codefetch/sdk without rewriting the library. The implementation follows the minimal, additive approach outlined in the design document.

## Changes Made

### 1. Environment Detection (`src/env.ts`)
- Added runtime detection for Cloudflare Worker environment
- Environment-specific cache size limits (8MB for Workers, 100MB for Node)
- Helper to check if git operations are available

### 2. Worker Entry Point (`src/worker.ts`)
- Created a new entry point that exports only Worker-safe APIs
- Excludes Node.js-specific features (file system, child_process)
- Exports web fetching, markdown generation, token counting, and utilities

### 3. Build Configuration (`build.worker.config.ts`)
- Separate build config targeting browser environment
- ESM-only output to `dist-worker/`
- Proper externals for nodejs_compat polyfills

### 4. Package Configuration Updates
- Added `/worker` export in package.json
- New build scripts: `build:worker` and `build:all`
- Include `dist-worker` in published files

### 5. Runtime Guards
- Added Worker check in `fetchGitRepository` to prevent git clone attempts
- Enhanced GitHub API to check Content-Length header (required in Workers)
- Added size limit check for Worker environment (8MB max)

### 6. Documentation
- Updated README with Worker usage section
- Created example Worker implementation
- Added wrangler.toml configuration example
- Documented limitations and Worker-safe exports

### 7. Testing
- Added minimal smoke tests for Worker environment detection
- Verified Worker exports are correctly limited

## Worker Limitations

1. **No local file system** - collectFiles/fetchFiles not available
2. **No git clone** - Only GitHub ZIP API supported
3. **10MB storage limit** - Large repos may exceed TmpFS
4. **Content-Length required** - Archives without size header rejected

## Usage

```typescript
import { fetchFromWeb } from "@codefetch/sdk/worker";

// Works with websites and GitHub repos
const result = await fetchFromWeb("https://github.com/owner/repo", {
  githubToken: env.GITHUB_TOKEN,
  maxFiles: 50,
  extensions: [".ts", ".js"],
});
```

## Build Commands

```bash
# Build both Node and Worker bundles
npm run build:all

# Build Worker bundle only
npm run build:worker
```

The implementation is complete and ready for use in Cloudflare Workers with the `nodejs_compat` flag.
